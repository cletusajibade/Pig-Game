# Pig-Game


This is an adaptation of the Pig game program from @jonasschmedtmann's Complete Javascript course on Udemy.

This program showcases the effective use of Javascript DOM manipulation.

## The rule of the game

The game has two players who take turns to role a dice. Your turn ends when you hold your current score or you role a 'one'. Note: rolling a 'one' causes you to lose your current score. So be careful.

Your goal is to maximise your score by holding it intermitently while also avoiding rolling a 'one'.

Each time you hold your current score, it gets added to the total score above the page.

## How do you win?

The first player to score a total of 100 or more points wins the game.
